# Tendril Agent

Tendril is the autonomous agent that runs inside your Kubernetes cluster. It is responsible for executing provisioning jobs sent by the Trellis platform.

## Features

- **Secure Polling**: Connects outbound to Trellis to fetch jobs. No inbound ports required.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Executes Terraform natively within the cluster.
- **Real-time Logging**: Streams execution logs back to the platform.
- **Integrity Checks**: Verifies configuration hashes before execution.

## Installation

The agent is typically installed via the Grape CLI during the bootstrap process:

```bash
grape bootstrap
```

Alternatively, it can be installed via Helm:

```bash
helm install tendril oci://ghcr.io/bobikenobi12/charts/tendril \
  --set config.clusterId=<CLUSTER_ID> \
  --set config.apiToken=<TOKEN>
```
