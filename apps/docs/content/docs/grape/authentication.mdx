# Authentication

The Grape CLI uses a Device Authorization Grant flow for authentication.

## Login

To log in:

```bash
grape login
```

This command will:
1.  Print a verification code and a URL.
2.  Open your browser to the verification URL.
3.  Wait for you to confirm the code in the browser.
4.  Store the access token securely.

## Logout

To log out:

```bash
grape logout
```

This removes the locally stored credentials.

## API Integration

The CLI communicates with the Grape Web API to verify tokens and fetch configurations. The API ensures that only authorized users can deploy infrastructure.
